# Coursera Guided Projects
This repository contains the projects that I completed 

### # Project 1 : Visualizing Filters of a CNN using TensorFlow

- We will use a Convolutional Neural Network - the popular VGG16 model, and we will visualize various filters from different layers of the CNN. 
- We will do this by using gradient ascent to visualize images that maximally activate specific filters from different layers of the model.
- We will be using TensorFlow as our machine learning framework.
- The project uses the Google Colab environment which is a fantastic tool for creating and running Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud, and Colab even provides free GPUs for your notebooks.

### # Project 2 : Creating Multi Task Models with Keras

 - Create and train multi-task, multi-output models with Keras. Used Keras' functional API to create a multi output model which will be trained to learn two different labels given the same input example. The model will have one input but two outputs. 
 - A few of the shallow layers will be shared between the two outputs, also used a ResNet style skip connection in the model.  
 - For example, an object detection model where a CNN is trained to find all class instances in the input images as well as give a regression output to localize the detected class instances in the input. 
 - The project uses the Google Colab environment.
