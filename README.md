This repository contains the projects that I completed 

### # Project 1 : Visualizing Filters of a CNN using TensorFlow

- We will use a Convolutional Neural Network - the popular VGG16 model, and we will visualize various filters from different layers of the CNN. We will do this by using gradient ascent to visualize images that maximally activate specific filters from different layers of the model.We will be using TensorFlow as our machine learning framework.
- The project uses the Google Colab environment which is a fantastic tool for creating and running Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud, and Colab even provides free GPUs for your notebooks.
